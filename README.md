# Risk-Managed Trading Strategy EDA

A hands-on, data-driven exploration that proves—even with a very ordinary entry/exit rule—adding basic risk-management transforms a strategy’s risk-adjusted returns. The notebook shows the journey from raw prices to an executive-ready report.

## 🎯  Objectives

1. **Validate the Hypothesis**  
   *For a fixed entry/exit algorithm, portfolios that apply stop-losses and position-sizing produce higher risk-adjusted returns and smaller drawdowns than portfolios that run “naked.”*

2. **Quantify the Impact**  
   *Measure Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, max drawdown, and capital efficiency for each variant (Baseline vs. two risk-managed flavors).*

3. **Tell a Clear Story**  
   *Interleave code, charts, and plain-English commentary so stakeholders see exactly how risk controls change the equity curve—and why it matters.*
